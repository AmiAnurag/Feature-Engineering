# Feature-Engineering
Different feature engineering skills . Traditional feature engineering is also covered along with all types of visulization technique and some modification making the engineering more effective.

Topics covered:

## Feature engineering for continous data :

  1.Mean / Median / Mode Imputation
  
  2.Random sample imputation
  
  3.End distribution Imputation
  
  4. A better way of storing information about nan values with increasing the dimensionality by one column only hence avoiding curse of dimensionality.
  
## Engineering techniques to handle missing value in categorical data
    
   
   1.Frequent Value Imputation
   
   2. New Value Imputation
   
   3. A new way of storing the nan information , this way can even predict the nature of missing values(mcar,mar,mnar)
