# Feature-Engineering
Different feature engineering skills . Traditional feature engineering is also covered along with all types of visulization technique and some modification making the engineering more effective.

Topics covered:

## Feature engineering for continous data :

  1.Mean / Median / Mode Imputation
  
  2.Random sample imputation
  
  3.End distribution Imputation
  
  4.A better way of storing information about nan values with increasing the dimensionality by one column only hence avoiding curse of dimensionality.
  
## Engineering techniques to handle missing value in categorical data
    
   
   1.Frequent Value Imputation
   
   2. New Value Imputation
   
   3. A new way of storing the nan information , this way can even predict the nature of missing values(mcar,mar,mnar)
  
## Labelling Techniques of Categorical Variable 

   1.Ordinal Encoding using sklearn OrdinalEncoder
   
   2.One Hot Encoding
   
   3.Ordinal Encoding based upon user define preference
   
   4.Count Frequency Encoding
   
   5.Target Guided Rank precedence ordinal encoding
   
   6.Mean Guided Ordinal Encoding
